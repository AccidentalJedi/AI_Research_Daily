# 🔬 The Lab - AI Research Daily

**Bridge the Gap Between Academic AI Research and Practical Implementation**

The Lab is a GitHub-native AI research intelligence platform that curates, translates, and contextualizes the daily firehose of 100+ AI papers into accessible, actionable insights for researchers and engineers.

## 🎯 What It Does

- **Curates Research**: Filters 100+ daily arXiv papers to 3-5 that matter most
- **Translates Papers**: Makes dense academic research accessible without oversimplifying
- **Tracks Implementation**: Monitors HuggingFace models and Papers with Code benchmarks
- **Contextualizes**: Places research in historical and future context
- **The Scholar Persona**: Rigorous, measured voice that teaches how to evaluate research
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies emerging trends 6-12 months early
- **Auto-Deploys**: Publishes to GitHub Pages with daily research intelligence
- **Zero Cost**: Runs on GitHub Actions free tier

## 📊 Example Output (The Scholar Style)

**From October 23, 2025:**

```markdown
# 📚 The Lab – 2025-10-23
## Today's Research Intelligence

*The Scholar here, translating today's research breakthroughs into actionable intelligence...*

**Today's Focus**: A significant advance in transformer efficiency appeared on arXiv, 
alongside three complementary papers on mixture-of-experts architectures.

### 🔬 Research Overview: Quick Stats
- **Papers Analyzed**: 127 from arXiv
- **Noteworthy Research**: 4 papers highlighted
- **SOTA Changes**: 2 benchmarks updated
- **Implementation**: 3 new HuggingFace models
- **Analysis Date**: 2025-10-23

### 📚 The Breakthrough
**"Sparse Attention Mechanisms for 100K+ Token Contexts"**

The core insight: instead of quadratic attention complexity, this paper proposes 
learned sparse patterns that achieve O(n log n) while maintaining performance...

### 🔗 Supporting Research
- **Paper 2**: Complementary approach to sparse routing
- **Paper 3**: Theoretical analysis of attention patterns

### 📈 From the Benchmarks

## 🆕 Core Features: Research Intelligence

### 📚 Research-Centric Scoring
Every paper gets a **research relevance score** (0-1) based on multiple factors:
- **≥0.8** = Breakthrough or highly significant
- **≥0.6** = Notable contribution
- **≥0.4** = Incremental but relevant
- **<0.4** = Filtered out

**Scoring factors**: Author reputation, citation velocity, novelty, benchmark performance, social signals, methodological innovation
