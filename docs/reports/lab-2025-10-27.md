## 🔧 For Builders: Research → Production

*Translating today's research into code you can ship next sprint.*

### The TL;DR

Today's research firehose scanned **0 papers** and surfaced **0 breakthrough papers** 【metrics:1】 across **0 research clusters** 【patterns:1】. Here's what you can build with it—right now.

### What's Ready to Ship

### 📋 Next-Sprint Checklist: Idea → Prototype in ≤2 Weeks

**Week 1: Foundation**
- [ ] **Day 1-2**: Pick one research cluster from above that aligns with your product vision
- [ ] **Day 3-4**: Clone the starter kit repo and run the demo—verify it works on your machine
- [ ] **Day 5**: Read the top breakthrough paper in that cluster (skim methods, focus on results)

**Week 2: Building**
- [ ] **Day 1-3**: Adapt the starter kit to your use case—swap in your data, tune parameters
- [ ] **Day 4-5**: Build a minimal UI/API around it—make it demoable to stakeholders

**Bonus**: Ship a proof-of-concept by Friday. Iterate based on feedback. You're now 2 weeks ahead of competitors still reading papers.

### 💡 Final Thought

Research moves fast, but **implementation moves faster**. The tools exist. The models are open-source. The only question is: what will you build with them?

*Don't just read about AI—ship it.* 🚀
