## 🔧 For Builders: Research → Production

*Translating today's research into code you can ship next sprint.*

### The TL;DR

Today's research firehose scanned **5 papers** and surfaced **0 breakthrough papers** 【metrics:1】 across **1 research clusters** 【patterns:1】. Here's what you can build with it—right now.

### What's Ready to Ship

#### 1. Language Models (5 papers) 【cluster:1】

**What it is**: The GPT-style text generators, chatbots, and understanding systems that power conversational AI.

**Why you should care**: Build custom chatbots, content generators, or Q&A systems fine-tuned for your domain. **Go from idea to working demo in a weekend.**

**Start building now**: Hugging Face Transformers

```bash
pip install transformers torch
python -c "import transformers"  # Test installation
# For advanced usage, see: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/quicktour
```

**Repo**: [https://github.com/huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)

**Use case**: Build chatbots, summarizers, or text analyzers in production 【toolkit:1】

**Timeline**: Strong convergence in Language Models - expect production adoption within 6-12 months 【inference:1】

### 📋 Next-Sprint Checklist: Idea → Prototype in ≤2 Weeks

**Week 1: Foundation**
- [ ] **Day 1-2**: Pick one research cluster from above that aligns with your product vision
- [ ] **Day 3-4**: Clone the starter kit repo and run the demo—verify it works on your machine
- [ ] **Day 5**: Read the top breakthrough paper in that cluster (skim methods, focus on results)

**Week 2: Building**
- [ ] **Day 1-3**: Adapt the starter kit to your use case—swap in your data, tune parameters
- [ ] **Day 4-5**: Build a minimal UI/API around it—make it demoable to stakeholders

**Bonus**: Ship a proof-of-concept by Friday. Iterate based on feedback. You're now 2 weeks ahead of competitors still reading papers.

### 💡 Final Thought

Research moves fast, but **implementation moves faster**. The tools exist. The models are open-source. The only question is: what will you build with them?

*Don't just read about AI—ship it.* 🚀
