# End-to-End Testing & Implementation Plan

## Status: READY FOR FINAL TESTING

All enhancements have been applied to `scripts/generate_report.py`. Now we need to verify the complete flow works end-to-end.

---

## Phase 1: Local Testing (Your Machine)

### Step 1.1: Verify Data Exists
```bash
# Check if today's data exists
ls -la data/aggregated/
ls -la data/insights/

# If not, use yesterday's data
ls -la data/aggregated/2025-10-25.json
ls -la data/insights/2025-10-25.json
```

**Expected**: Files should exist with recent dates

### Step 1.2: Test Enhanced Report Generation
```bash
# Run the enhanced report generator
python scripts/generate_report.py

# Check for output
ls -la docs/reports/
ls -la reports/
```

**Expected**: 
- âœ… No errors
- âœ… Report file created: `pulse-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- âœ… File contains new sections

### Step 1.3: Verify New Sections in Report
```bash
# Check for new sections
grep -n "Ecosystem Intelligence Summary" docs/reports/pulse-*.md
grep -n "Breakthrough Discoveries" docs/reports/pulse-*.md
grep -n "Signal Strength" docs/reports/pulse-*.md
grep -n "What to Watch" docs/reports/pulse-*.md
```

**Expected**: All 4 new sections should be present

### Step 1.4: Verify EchoVein Personality Maintained
```bash
# Check for EchoVein voice
grep -n "EchoVein" docs/reports/pulse-*.md
grep -n "vein" docs/reports/pulse-*.md
grep -n "artery" docs/reports/pulse-*.md
```

**Expected**: EchoVein personality throughout

4. ingest_issues.py âœ…
5. ingest_tools.py âœ…
6. ingest_bounties.py âœ…
7. ingest_nostr.py âœ…
8. aggregate.py âœ…
9. mine_insights.py âœ…
10. Commit and push âœ…
```

**Expected**: All steps pass

### Step 2.3: Trigger Daily Report Workflow
```bash
# Go to GitHub Actions tab
# Click "Ollama Pulse Daily Report"
# Click "Run workflow"
# Select "main" branch
# Check "force_run" checkbox
# Click "Run workflow"
```

**Expected**:
- âœ… Workflow starts
- âœ… Report generation completes
- âœ… Nostr posting completes (or skips if no key)
- âœ… Report committed and pushed
- âœ… GitHub Pages updated

### Step 2.4: Verify Report on GitHub Pages
```bash
# Visit: https://grumpified-oggvct.github.io/ollama_pulse
# Check:
1. Latest report visible âœ…
2. New sections present âœ…
3. EchoVein personality visible âœ…
4. All links work âœ…
5. Formatting correct âœ…
```

**Expected**: Report displays correctly with all enhancements

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Report doesn't generate
**Solution**: 
1. Check data files exist: `ls data/aggregated/`
2. Run test: `python test_enhanced_report.py`
3. Check for errors: `python scripts/generate_report.py 2>&1`

### Issue: New sections missing
**Solution**:
1. Verify `generate_report.py` has enhancements
2. Check for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile scripts/generate_report.py`
3. Run test: `python test_enhanced_report.py`

### Issue: GitHub Pages not updating
**Solution**:
1. Check Actions tab for errors
2. Verify Pages settings: Settings â†’ Pages
3. Check branch is `main` and folder is `/docs` or `/reports`
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

### Issue: Nostr posting fails
**Solution**:
1. Check if `NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY` secret is set
2. Verify key format (should start with `nsec1`)
3. Check workflow logs for error details
4. Can safely ignore if not configured
