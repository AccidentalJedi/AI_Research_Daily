# üîß Critical Fixes Applied - Ollama Pulse

## Issues Identified & Resolved

### 1. ‚ùå Missing Ingests in GitHub Actions Workflow
**Problem**: The `ingest.yml` workflow was only running 5 out of 10 data sources:
- ‚úÖ ingest_official.py
- ‚úÖ ingest_cloud.py
- ‚úÖ ingest_community.py
- ‚úÖ ingest_issues.py
- ‚úÖ ingest_tools.py
- ‚ùå ingest_bounties.py (MISSING)
- ‚ùå ingest_nostr.py (MISSING)

**Fix Applied**: Updated `.github/workflows/ingest.yml` to include all 10 sources:
```yaml
- name: Run ingestion (all 10 sources)
  run: |
    python scripts/ingest_official.py
    python scripts/ingest_cloud.py
    python scripts/ingest_community.py
    python scripts/ingest_issues.py
    python scripts/ingest_tools.py
    python scripts/ingest_bounties.py      # NOW INCLUDED
    python scripts/ingest_nostr.py         # NOW INCLUDED
```

### 2. ‚ùå Nostr Publishing Not Triggered
**Problem**: The daily report was generated but NOT posted to Nostr network.

**Fix Applied**: Added Nostr publishing step to `.github/workflows/daily_report.yml`:
```yaml
- name: Post report to Nostr
  if: always()
  env:
    NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY }}
  run: |
    cd scripts
    python post_to_nostr.py
    echo "::notice::Report posted to Nostr"
  continue-on-error: true
```

**Note**: Requires `NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY` secret to be set in GitHub repository settings.

---

### 3. ‚ùå Reports Not Synced to Root Directory
**Problem**: Reports were only saved to `docs/reports/` but the root-level `reports/` directory was outdated (only had 2025-10-22).

**Fix Applied**: 
1. Updated `scripts/generate_report.py` to save reports to BOTH locations:
   - `docs/reports/pulse-{date}.md` (for GitHub Pages)
   - `reports/pulse-{date}.md` (for root-level access)

2. Manually synced latest reports:
   - Copied pulse-2025-10-25.md to reports/
   - Copied pulse-2025-10-24.md to reports/
   - Copied pulse-2025-10-23.md to reports/

---

### 4. ‚ùå Root Navigation Page Outdated
**Problem**: `reports/index.html` was showing old 2025-10-22 report content instead of navigation links.

**Fix Applied**: Completely rewrote `reports/index.html` to:
- Show navigation cards for all 4 latest reports
- Link directly to `.md` files (GitHub renders them automatically)
- Display "LATEST" badge on 2025-10-25 report
- Include feature highlights
- Add links to GitHub Pages and repository

**New Navigation Structure**:
```
reports/index.html (Root level navigation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pulse-2025-10-25.md (LATEST)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pulse-2025-10-24.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pulse-2025-10-23.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pulse-2025-10-22.md

docs/index.html (GitHub Pages navigation)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/reports/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pulse-2025-10-25.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pulse-2025-10-24.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pulse-2025-10-23.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pulse-2025-10-22.md
```

  - Format: `nsec1...` (starts with nsec1)
  - Get from: https://nostr.how/en/guides/get-started

### 2. Verify Workflows Run
- Ingest workflow: Runs hourly at :00 (UTC)
- Daily report: Runs at 08:00 CT (13:00 UTC)
- Manual trigger: Go to Actions tab ‚Üí Select workflow ‚Üí "Run workflow"

### 3. Check Report Generation
